## OVERVIEW
This is a prime spot in summer, where it typically gets very busy. But it should not be missed during shoulder seasons. It’s low elevation (3000ft high point) means that it will be warmer than most trails that gain a lot of elevation (typically 5,000-6000ft high point). It was that reason I chose this trail. Lots of rain and cold weather coming in meant most trails would be getting hit with snow, but this one was low enough where it’d be raining for most of my stay.
