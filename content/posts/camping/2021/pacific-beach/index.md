## THE BEACH
I had reserved a camping spot for one night at Pacific Beach State Park. It was a pretty no-frills spot, but the best part was that it was right on the beach. Right over the mound was an incredible view of the pacific ocean.

I was a little out of place being the only person that didn't have a giant RV or camper, but I also had not spent any time setting up or packing up. So as soon as I pulled into my spot, I got out and headed straight to the beach withe the pups.

 The expanse of the beach alone is stunning. There were wind surfers and surfboard surfers catching waves on the never ending waves. Flocks of birds were poking their bills in the sand. Dogs ran around freely, splashing in the shallow areas of the water. And the sunset. It. Was. Incredible.

 The water was pretty far out from the start of the beach while I was there, so there miles of hard-packed sand to roam around on. And not just by foot, there is a section of the beach where cars are allowed to drive on. So on the second day I had picked up a waffle and coffee at *coffee shop* and drove on to the beach to enjoy it. Afterwards, I had some fun by driving around on it.
