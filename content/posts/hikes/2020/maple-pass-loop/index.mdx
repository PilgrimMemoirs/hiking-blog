description: I typically avoid crowded hikes, but Maple Pass Loop during "larch season" is an exception. The 7.5 miles of this trail go quickly as every quarter of a mile changes so dramatically with mountain views. Top it with an array of foliage transitioned into fall colors and you have yourself one of the dreamiest hikes around.
