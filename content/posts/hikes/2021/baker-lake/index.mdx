description: Baker Lake is my go-to for an easy, (mostly) snow-free hike in winter. Year-round it remains lush with ferns and large trees that are covered in moss and lichen. This trail also has a couple of campgrounds that are great to backpack to and enjoy some time at the lake.

## TRAIL REPORT
I went mid-week, starting around noon. Only saw maybe 5 other people total. It  gets much busier on weekends, and is always very crowded come summer. Understandably so, since there is prime camping and access to the lake via a dock.

In winter, it is a perfect option for avoiding any hazardous winter conditions. The most you'll likely have to deal with is rain trickling off the trees that tower above. There are tons of water crossings, but most have really nice bridges built over them so you have a very good chance of keeping your feet completely dry.

This trail is mostly flat, with only a few very small/quick climbs coming up from the campsites. So it's super accessible to anyone who can climb over a moderately-sized downed tree.

 The trail goes for 13+ miles along the lake, most people stop and turn around at the 2nd campground (Maple Grove, 8 miles rt). If you're wanting to escape crowds, you can also access the trail on the north end.

Overall, I always recommend this hike for beginners and anyone not wanting to deal with any extreme/unpredictable conditions.
