description: Got some miles in and (mostly) socially distanced at Bake Lake

<p>With Covid-19 getting serious, the already limited early spring hiking options became more limited. At this point people were starting to have been cooped up in their houses for two weeks. With hiking being one of the only activities not off the table, any hike within an hour drive of Seattle was going to get flooded with people…. and definitely not be possible to maintain the 6-foot rule.</p>

<p>I’ve had Baker Lake on my list as an early spring hike and figured it was as good as time as ever to check it off. While I tend not to revisit the same hike in the same year, I’m thinking this hike is going to turn into a go-to while quarantine is still happening.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the trailhead there was actually a decent amount of cars, enough to start lining up along the road after. I had saw at least 20-30, but there was more past where I found a spot, so easily could have been more.</p>
