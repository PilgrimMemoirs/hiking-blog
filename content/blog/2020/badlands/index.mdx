On the return trip back from driving to visiting my family, I decided to add a couple of stops to explore what I could with only a couple of spare days and an America the Beautiful pass. First up was The Badlands. I’d been wanting to see this National Park since having to drive past it while I drove a uhaul from Chicago to Seattle under an incredibly strict deadline. So no stops.

Now the only thing restricting me was having two dogs. Every National Park is different in how strict they are with dogs, but in general they’re always pretty strict. I tend to ask for recommendations at the ranger stations and take advantage of whatever limited options are given.

The Badlands have some of the more loose rules I’ve encountered, where they were allowed on boardwalks and viewpoints, but not on trails. Fair enough.

Fortunately the entire 40 miles on the main road, on highway 240, was one long scenic drive with plenty of viewpoints.

One thing that ruins National Parks for me is having to fight with crowds to see anything. I arrived fairly early, but I was still surprised by how few people in the park. I had most of the stops to myself and only passed a few other cars on the highway.


This was especially nice when I encountered a herd of bighorn sheep. They were completely unbothered by me slowly rolling past and taking photos. Mind you, I’m sure they’re used to having to deal with a lot more people, but still shocking to actually experience in person, all to myself.

With it being the middle of winter, I had set my expectations low with what I’d be able to see. But everything was surprisingly accessible, with the park only having a dusting of snow and well-maintained roads. It’s definitely worth driving through the park as a way to break up the long i-90 drive. Especially if you have an America The Beautiful pass, which is easily my most used pass since it covers all National Parks and forests.

The original plan was to head straight towards a hotel near Yellowstone after The Badlands. Once I realized that Mount Rustmore and the Devils Tower were also reasonable detours from i-90, I made it my mission to visit both before checking into that hotel much later than anticipated.
